synopsis: let's revisit the design

details: 

Diagram:

We need a good separation of the GUI from the logic.

We need to represent the input colors and the output colors (Silver, etc.).

Using shaded diamond (composition) is not a good idea at this level compared to the unshaded diamond (aggregation).

What do the dotted lines mean? Instead use proper UML notation for association or aggregation.

Please show cardinality only if different from the default value of 1.
