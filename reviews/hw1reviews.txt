synopsis: let's restructure, write, bring in details and depth

details: 

Lot of code with no related discussion is of no use. We can remove all the code and provide concise examples in words instead.

1.

Let's start with one paragraph that provides context or details.

Then, one short paragraph each for a consequence or a benefit. State the consequence or the benefit and then one or two sentences to support that or bring in more detail about that consequence or benefit.

We can remove the code examples from here and instead state in one of two sentences in the first paragraph what high vs. low cohesion means.

Please structure as definition or context in one paragraph. Then multiple paragraphs wth each focusing on one consequence or benefit.

2.

"Tight coupling is a concept where modules are strongly interdependent." That is cyclic dependency, let us focus on tight vs. loose.

No need for code example here. Instead in the first paragraph let us define what tight vs. loose is in one sentence. Then in a second sentence give a crisp example to illustrate tight. vs. loose coupling.

Then, multiple short paragraphs with one consequence or benefit per paragraph. Support with details in a second or third sentence in each paragraph.

3.

"classes.In" space after . please.

No need for a code example.

One short paragraph, tell us what this is, provide context.

Then, multiple short paragraphs, with each paragraph focusing on one consequence. State, support with details.

4.

No need for a code example.

One short paragraph, tell us what this is, provide context.

Then, multiple short paragraphs, with each paragraph focusing on one consequence. State, support with details.
